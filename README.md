# SpMV through CSR-K method

## Usage
### Single execution on cluster

To run the code using the `.pbs` file;
The arguments for the program must be passed through the `-v` flag to have them as ambient variables;
Useful to check the results of a single matrix and to try different numbers of threads.
```
    qsub -q short_cpuQ -v MATRIX_FILE="[matrix_file_address]",N_THREADS="[number_of_threads] ./del1_single_matrix.pbs
```

### Multiple executions on cluster

This `.pbs` file has fixed files and number of threads;
It runs the code on 5 different matrix, with the objective of easily collect batch data, also useful to quickly obtain plotting data.

```
    qsub -q short_cpuQ ./del1_multiple_matrixes.pbs
```

### Data plotting

The `plotter.py` Python script can be executed outside the cluster with the "to_plot" folder generated by the multiple execution to obtain a plotting showing the various speedup on the various matrixes;
It's tailor made to use all the matrixes, and won't work without any of their results.

```
    py plotter.py
```

## Additional usage
### Single execution

The `deliverable1.c` can be manually compiled and run.

```
    gcc -O3 -fopenmp deliverable1.c -o del1
    ./del1 [matrix_file_address] [number_of_threads]
```
